# LoadMemory — warm resume

Restore session state and report drift. This is the cheap path: state only, no
codebase tour. Use `/primer` when the agent needs the project explained.

## 1. Find and read saved state

`ls` the repo root first — do not assume the filename. The usual name is
`SESSION_MEMORY.md`, but a project may use another, and some carry several
scoped variants. If exactly one exists, read it. If several exist, read the
unqualified one and name the others rather than merging them.

If none exists, say so and stop: there is nothing to resume, and `/primer` is
the right command.

Parse every section: Resume, Active Work, Git State, Runtime, **Gotchas**, and
Next Session Kickoff.

Read Gotchas even though the report below only echoes them on request. Step 5 can
hand off to `/BackupMemory`, which carries forward what it was told — anything
you skipped here is a line you may help delete.

## 2. Check drift

**Drift** is any gap between what the file claims and what the repo shows. Batch:

- `git status -sb` — branch and ahead/behind, against the saved Git State
- `git status --short | grep -v '^??'` — tracked-only, the unit the memory file
  records; a raw listing counts untracked tooling dirs and fakes drift
- `git log --oneline -5` — what landed since the file was written
- `gh pr list --state open`
- `gh workflow list`, then the build/publish workflow's
  `gh run list --workflow "<name>" --limit 3 --json headSha,conclusion`

If `gh` errors, say so once and continue git-only. If `gh workflow list` succeeds
but is empty, the repo has no CI — say that rather than reporting a failed build.
An empty `conclusion` means the run is still going: report "running".

Trust the repo over the file. Name each mismatch specifically — "memory says
`4b172f9b`, HEAD is `8b36d9f7`" beats "state has drifted."

A green build usually means artifacts were published, not that anything was
deployed. Treat a "deployed" claim as unverified unless the repo documents a
deploy check and you run it.

## 3. Hydrate active work

Find the Active Work table's tracker column — commonly `Issue`, but it may carry
another name. Hydrate **only cells that are a bare `#N` or `N`**:

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json title,state --jq '"\(.state)  \(.title)"'
```

Skip everything else, and say what you skipped rather than silently passing:

- a placeholder — either `—` (em dash) or an ASCII `-`
- several ids in one cell
- a legacy tracker id such as `repo-a1b2` — `gh issue view` errors on these
- a **cross-repo** reference such as `otherrepo #492`. That number belongs to a
  different repo; running it here resolves against the wrong one and either
  errors or, worse, returns an unrelated issue

If the column is named for a retired tracker, its ids are dead: report them as
unhydratable and suggest migrating them, rather than guessing at counterparts.

An issue the file calls open but `gh` calls closed is drift — report it.

## 4. Report

```
## Session Restored

**Resume**: [the file's Resume, verbatim]

**Kickoff**: [the file's Next Session Kickoff, verbatim — or "absent" if missing]

**Drift**: ✅ none | ⚠️ [specific mismatches, one per line]

**Active Work** (hydrated):
| Item | Issue | State | Key Files |
```

Add nothing beyond this skeleton — the quoted sections run as long as they run,
and truncating a verbatim Resume or Kickoff defeats the point. Carry the file's
`Key Files` column through unchanged; it is the next agent's only pointer into
the code.

## 5. Resync on drift

When the repo and the file disagree, ask: "Memory is stale — resync it?" On yes,
run `/BackupMemory`, which updates the file in place and carries forward Gotchas
and any unresolved 🔴 row. That closes the loop so the next session starts from
truth instead of inheriting the same stale file.

## Done when

Every drift check has run, every bare-`#N` cell is hydrated and every skipped
cell named, and the kickoff is quoted or its absence flagged.
